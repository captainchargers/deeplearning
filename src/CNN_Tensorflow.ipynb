    "By minimizing the difference between target and output, the CNN will eventually have meaningful filters (head, tail, diagonal connector, round, triangle) and also meaningful classifier with these feature maps.  \n",

The local minimum value of Loss is where derivative Loss with respect to W is 0. Therefore everytime we update W, we slightly update W with negative direction of derivative and find local minimum. "
